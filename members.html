        If you’re interested in knowing more about each member of the Sauti Sol band, read on below. It’s interesting to know that all the band members were born in the same year, with Bien-Aime Baraza being the youngest and Savara Mudigi being the oldest. Belonging to the same age group is probably why the artists have managed to stay together for more than thirteen years.

      <h2>Bien-Aime Baraza</h2>
      <p>Born on 28 December 1987, Bien is a talented songwriter, guitarist and vocalist. He is the most outspoken Sauti Sol member and possesses a degree in Journalism and Media Studies from the United States International University. Apart from being a Sauti Sol member, Bien has also written for artists such as Wendy Kimani, and Amos & Josh. The musician’s tall height, toned abs and astounding vocals have for the longest time made girls go crazy for him. So, many were disappointed when the gifted musician proposed to his girlfriend Chiki Kuruka, who is a dance fitness enthusiast and model, in 2019. They tied the knot on 6 March 2020 in a private wedding ceremony.</p>
